    Description: This page is the about page for the website. It is, well, I got bored and started typing a mock interview,
        and I kind of just kept going.....there isnt too much else to it. Hope you enjoy Geoff or whoever is marking (I know
        you mentioned Lorem Ipsum is boring, so I tried something).
