    Description: This page is the about page for the website. It is, well, I got bored and started typing a mock interview,
        and I kind of just kept going.....there isnt too much else to it. Hope you enjoy Geoff or whoever is marking (I know
        you mentioned Lorem Ipsum is boring, so I tried something).

    <h1>Who is the people behind GarageBay?</h1>
    <p>GarageBay is the project creation of Romulo Yorvez, a student who is ok, well when i say ok, he's well, hes ok at web design. He had to learn this thingy called ASP .NET which is a little confusing 
        in a sort that a cat wearing boots is cool but weird in another sense. OH YEAH, the site. Um, well, he worked on it for about, um, I guess it was 6 weeks. He had the deadline of sunday at the 
        end of 5 weeks, so it was more 5 weeks I guess. He's not great with cars, not sure why he picked it, but I guess he stuck with it. Might have something to do with his dad's love for cars 
        and eBay, so that could be something i guess.</p>

    <h2>Ok, but why did he make it, and don't drag on please</h2>
    <p>OH yeah yeah, sorry about that, yeah, that tends to happen. Well you see it was a university project that was meant to create a login system and products and stuff and I guess he needed to do that 
        kind of stuff for it. I mean he also needed filler which is why he threw lorem Ipsum, a game quote and a 9 minute beat poem lyrics section on the main page. I dont remember what he did to the
        about page, he said it was something along the lines of questions about the website, im not sure. He was told the design didn't have to be magical or anything, just that it was easy to understand 
        the queries would need to be ready for data access and business stuff.
