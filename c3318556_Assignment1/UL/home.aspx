    Description: This is the default home page of the website, called home of course. Most redirects go here including logging
        out, non-admin user kicks, invocie redirects and logins. I added an image simply for testing purposes and the text
        is there for fun. Hope you enjoy the reading.

    <h2>Do I ever tell you about the definition of insanity?</h2>
    <p>
        Insanity is doing the exact... same fucking thing... over and over again expecting... shit to change... That. Is. Crazy. The first time somebody told me that, I dunno, I thought they were 
        bullshitting me, so, I shot him. The thing is... He was right. And then I started seeing, everywhere I looked, everywhere I looked all these fucking pricks, everywhere I looked, doing the exact 
        same fucking thing... over and over and over and over again thinking 'this time is gonna be different' no, no, no please... This time is gonna be different, I'm sorry, I don't like... 
        The way...
    </p>
    <p>
        ... you are looking at me... Okay, Do you have a fucking problem in your head, do you think I am bullshitting you, do you think I am lying? Fuck you! Okay? Fuck you!... It's okay, man. I'm gonna 
        chill, hermano. I'm gonna chill... The thing is... Alright, the thing is I killed you once already... and it's not like I am fucking crazy. It's okay... It's like water under the bridge. 
        Did I ever tell you the definition... of insanity?

    <h2>Tim Minchen's Storm</h2>
    <p>
        Inner North London, top floor flat
        All white walls, white carpet, white cat,
        Rice Paper partitions, modern art and ambition
        The host's a physician,
        Bright bloke, has his own practice
        His girlfriend's an actress, an old mate of ours from home
        And they're always great fun, so to dinner we've come.The 5th guest is an unknown,
        The hosts have just thrown us together for a favour 'cause this girl's just arrived from Australia
        And she's moved to North London and she's the sister of someone or has some connection.As we make introductions I'm struck by her beauty
        She's irrefutably fair with dark eyes and dark hair
        But as she sits, I admit I'm a little bit wary 'cause I notice the tip of the wing of a fairy tattooed on that popular area just above the derrière
        And when she says "I'm Sagittarian", I confess a pigeonhole starts to form
        And is immediately filled with pigeon when she says her name is Storm.
